Hi everyone! This is my first blog and it is about end of my beautiful college journey at National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. 
It is more of a review for the students that may join the college in the forthcoming years. 
I still can't believe 4 years drifted so fast, and I graduated from the college!

This is going to be very detailed, and may even extend to multiple posts, so sit tight!

## About Me

I am Naman Garg and got 99.588 percentile in JEE Mains 2021 with 4533 AIR and 6518 AIR in JEE Advanced 2021.
I did not take any drop and am from Haryana, and didn't take any drop, and even go to school regularly in along with coaching in 11th. 
Just before starting 12th, covid-19 strikes and I am much deviated from JEE preparation, and started exploring software development, 
which is not in the scope of this article.

At this rank, being a general candidate, I had only 4 options under consideration at that time -- NIT Kurukshetra Computer Engineering, 
IIIT Allahabad Information and Technology, IIT Jodhpur Electrical and Electronics Engineering and IIT Delhi Textile Engineering.

I chose NIT Kurukshetra Computer Engineering due to proximity to my house as well as good reputation at that time. 
It is undoubtedly the best engineering college in Haryana at the time of writing.

I filed NIT Kurukshetra CSE on the topmost spot and got and automatically freeze in the first round in JoSAA.

## Location and Campus

Campus is really huge and beautiful, it is 300 acre for NIT + 473 acre for Kurukshetra University, which is adjacent to NIT. 
There is a wall with a gate between KUK and NIT, and there are 5-6 guards 24x7 there. 
There's no trespassing as such between NIT and KUK. So, you get to enjoy KUK facilities as well, like sports ground, 
without having much trouble. In fact we have quite good bonding with KUK guys, and play together in the evening (basketball).

Although, NIT Kurukshetra is located in Thanesar, which is like a bit outer side of Kurukshetra, 
yet all the facilities are available on campus. You have blinkit, zomato, swiggy etc. services available.

**Facilities in Campus :** There is a market, with various shops, like general store, stationary store, medical store, juice shop, 
SBI Bank branch and ATM, barber, washing/dry cleaning shop, 1 small eatery and a Dominos! 
There's also a senate hall canteen, which serves decently good food at fairly cheap prices. 

Apart from these, there's a Moxie, that is again serving food/tea, but has much more variety. There's also a juice corner in front of library.

But all of these are open till 9pm-11pm only. If you want late night food, there's a lot of options there too. 
There's maggie hotspot near the boys hostel, that serves at least a dozen types of maggie, has nestle coffee machine, 
nestle chocolates, burgers and sandwiches etc. Another option is H6 shop, that has variety of packed food, like chips, kurkure, cold drink, 
biscuits etc and also maggie and paranthas. These open till 2pm.

If you are still not satified / want food at 3 am / want non veg, there's eateries just outside the main gate, 
that deliver food at backgate (that is just outside H7 or H8) even till 3 am ( I haven't tested after that, but they do deliver at least till 3 am ). 
You can order anything from them - they have fairly large menu and cheap prices and okayish food quality.
