Hi everyone! This is my first blog and it is about end of my beautiful college journey at National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. 
It is more of a review for the students that may join the college in the forthcoming years. 
I still can't believe 4 years drifted so fast, and I graduated from the college!

This is going to be very detailed, and may even extend to multiple posts, so sit tight!

## About Me

I am Naman Garg and got 99.588 percentile in JEE Mains 2021 with 4533 AIR and 6518 AIR in JEE Advanced 2021.
I did not take any drop and am from Haryana, and didn't take any drop, and even go to school regularly in along with coaching in 11th. 
Just before starting 12th, covid-19 strikes and I am much deviated from JEE preparation, and started exploring software development, 
which is not in the scope of this article.

At this rank, being a general candidate, I had only 4 options under consideration at that time -- NIT Kurukshetra Computer Engineering, 
IIIT Allahabad Information and Technology, IIT Jodhpur Electrical and Electronics Engineering and IIT Delhi Textile Engineering.

I chose NIT Kurukshetra Computer Engineering due to proximity to my house as well as good reputation at that time. 
It is undoubtedly the best engineering college in Haryana at the time of writing.

I filed NIT Kurukshetra CSE on the topmost spot and got and automatically freeze in the first round in JoSAA.

## Location and Campus

Campus is really huge and beautiful, it is 300 acre for NIT + 473 acre for Kurukshetra University, which is adjacent to NIT. 
There is a wall with a gate between KUK and NIT, and there are 5-6 guards 24x7 there. 
There's no trespassing as such between NIT and KUK. So, you get to enjoy KUK facilities as well, like sports ground, 
without having much trouble. In fact we have quite good bonding with KUK guys, and play together in the evening (basketball).

Although, NIT Kurukshetra is located in Thanesar, which is like a bit outer side of Kurukshetra, 
yet all the facilities are available on campus. You have blinkit, zomato, swiggy etc. services available.

There is also [Brahma Sarovar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahma_Sarovar) that is not very far from NIT Kurukshetra, and its best place to go to in the evening.

Overall, if you like calm vibes, NIT Kurukshetra is one of the best colleges for you!


### Facilities in Campus

There is a market, with various shops, like general store, stationary store, medical store, juice shop, 
SBI Bank branch and ATM, barber, washing/dry cleaning shop, 1 small eatery and a Dominos! 
There's also a senate hall canteen, which serves decently good food at fairly cheap prices. 

Apart from these, there's a Moxie, that is again serving food/tea, but has much more variety. There's also a juice corner in front of library.

But all of these are open till 9pm-11pm only. If you want late night food, there's a lot of options there too. 
There's maggie hotspot near the boys hostel, that serves at least a dozen types of maggie, has nestle coffee machine, 
nestle chocolates, burgers and sandwiches etc. Another option is H6 shop, that has variety of packed food, like chips, kurkure, cold drink, 
biscuits etc and also maggie and paranthas. These open till 2pm.

If you are still not satified / want food at 3 am / want non veg, there's eateries just outside the main gate, 
that deliver food at backgate (that is just outside H7 or H8) even till 3 am ( I haven't tested after that, but they do deliver at least till 3 am ). 
You can order anything from them - they have fairly large menu and cheap prices and okayish food quality.

### Sports

Sports facilities are good. Sports complex is generally open till 9pm, and have good floodlights for late night matches. Sports complex is really well maintained.

* For badminton, there's an outside court in the sports complex, having 2 nets and 1 indoor court, for professional players. Indoor court is very well maintained and
Faculty members also play in indoor court. Apart from these, there's court in almost every hostel for badminton.
* For table tennis, there's table in each hostel, and there's a special hostel where it is reserved for professional players and have multiple tables.
* For volleyball, there's a court in each hostel, and 2 courts in sports complex for professionals.
* For basketball, there's a court in sports complex and some hostels have separate courts, but not very well maintained. 
KUK has 3 courts, which is like 500m from our sports complex and anyone can go play in them.
* For football, there's huge ground in sports complex, which is pretty well maintained.
* For cricket, well, you can use the sports ground, or go to KU. You can play gully cricket in Hostels itself, there's more than enough space.
* Yoga classes are held daily in the sports complex.
* There's also a 400m athletic track in the sports complex.
* There's also a lawn tennis court, but no one plays lawn tennis at all.
* Kabaddi is also played in sports complex. There's a bit separate area for that.
* Gym is also there, but is always crowded. You can join gym outside campus, there are plenty of them.
* There's a swimming pool as well, which is closed since covid. They did open it last year I guess, Idk what happened to it. Never went there.

I guess I covered all the sports that I know. Also, you can borrow the equipment like balls, rackets etc. from sports complex, but only till 5 pm. 
If you are professional, they'll allow you to keep it for night as well.

### Cultural Clubs

There are many clubs in college that are pretty active. They are different from technical socities because technical socities are more closely monitored
by a faculty member and are more focused. Technical societies organise [TechSpardha](https://www.techspardha.in/), the technical fest while cultural club organises 
[Confluence](https://nitkkr.ac.in/confluence/), the cultural fest.

### Technical Societies

There are many technical societies in college that are pretty active. They are different from technical socities because technical socities are more closely monitored
