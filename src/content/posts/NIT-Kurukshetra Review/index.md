Hi everyone! This is my first blog and it is about end of my beautiful college journey at National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. 
It is more of a review for the students that may join the college in the forthcoming years. 
I still can't believe 4 years drifted so fast, and I graduated from the college!

This is going to be very detailed, and may even extend to multiple posts, so sit tight!

## About Me

I am Naman Garg and got 99.588 percentile in JEE Mains 2021 with 4533 AIR and 6518 AIR in JEE Advanced 2021.
I did not take any drop and am from Haryana, and didn't take any drop, and even go to school regularly in along with coaching in 11th. 
Just before starting 12th, covid-19 strikes and I am much deviated from JEE preparation, and started exploring software development, 
which is not in the scope of this article.

At this rank, being a general candidate, I had only 4 options under consideration at that time -- NIT Kurukshetra Computer Engineering, 
IIIT Allahabad Information and Technology, IIT Jodhpur Electrical and Electronics Engineering and IIT Delhi Textile Engineering.

I chose NIT Kurukshetra Computer Engineering due to proximity to my house as well as good reputation at that time. 
It is undoubtedly the best engineering college in Haryana at the time of writing.

I filed NIT Kurukshetra CSE on the topmost spot and got and automatically freeze in the first round in JoSAA.
