Hi everyone! This is my first blog and it is about end of my beautiful college journey at National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. 
It is more of a review for the students that may join the college in the forthcoming years. 
I still can't believe 4 years drifted so fast, and I graduated from the college!

This is going to be very detailed, and may even extend to multiple posts, so sit tight!
